# Employee Tracker

## Description

In this challenge, our job was to create a database with employees, departments, roles, and managers. With the database, we should be able to add and remove employees, roles, and departments. This solves a problem with being able to keep track of employees and their roles and descriptions. I learned how to connect databases and files to create a responsive application through the command line. 

## Installation

To install the program you need to use npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to begin. You also need to install npm i ansi-colors to color the terminal to give it more character. You also need to connect mysql to the files as well to pull and run the database.
